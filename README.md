Stolen credit card numbers are sold to brokers who resell them to carders who use them to buy prepaid credit cards that are then used to buy gift cards that will be used to buy merchandise that is shipped to a reshipper who sends it on to its final destination before it is sold for profit.
Why is such a complex process used instead of simply using the stolen numbers to buy the products that are desired?
1 point
 
If done quickly, there is a multiplying effect in play. The stolen credit card can be used to buy 3 or 4 prepaid cards each valued at the credit limit of the original card.

Because stolen cards can rarely be used directly to purchase merchandise.
 
To make the end-to-end transaction very difficult to follow.
